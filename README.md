## JS Introductory Unit test exercise (deadline July 25)

* Clone the [Frontend Training repository](https://github.com/codelex-io/frontend-training).
* Look at the existing examples for tests in [`fun.test.ts`](https://github.com/codelex-io/frontend-training/blob/master/exercises/minesweeper/react-minesweeper/src/fun.test.ts).
  - Implement a suite of tests that would describe the expected behavior for the `stateAfterClick` function. Describe how state should update when user clicks on fields with 0 bombs around them, where surrounding fields should be revealed automatically.
  - Improve the implementation of `stateAfterClick` function ensuring that your tests pass.

## JS Classes & Objects exercises (deadline August 3rd)

* Complete [Exercise #4](https://github.com/codelex-io/frontend-syllabus/tree/master/js-basics/exercises#exercise-4) together with working unit test and add it to your *js-exercises* repository under medium exercises;
* Complete [Video Store](https://github.com/codelex-io/javascript-exercises/tree/master/src/exercises/oop/video-store) in your repository;
* **Give me more!** - complete [Flight Planner](https://github.com/codelex-io/frontend-syllabus/tree/master/js-basics/exercises#exercise-6) in your repository.

## Shopping Cart in React (deadline August 12th)

In a new repository create a shopping cart from scratch.

### Acceptance criteria:

* User sees a list of products on the left side;
* User sees the list of products he has chosen on the right side;
* Every product has the fields name quantity price and sum;
* Clicking on an item on the left should add it to the cart - Clicking on it the second time should increase the quantity - we don't want to see duplicates
* At the bottom of the cart users see the total component which shows the total price x quantity of items selected.
* *And at least 6 Bonus Features from these (or your own ideas):*
    - A few of the products have a discount - "Pay for 2, get 3rd one for free". Implement this logic to your cart - so that total price of the item and all cart is updated correctly as user adds/removes items to the cart.
    - On page reload the cart is not lost - you may use `localStorage`.
    - Items appear/disappear from the cart with an animation (or fly from the shop to cart via an animation) - [Spring based animatiopns](https://www.react-spring.io/) are really nice.
    - Users can use [Drag & Drop](https://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/examples/dustbin/multiple-targets) to re-order the items, or add/remove them from shore to cart
    - Every 1 000 000th visitor of the site sees a popup that he is the 1 000 000th visitor of this site and he wins a car
        ![new car](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/new_car.png)
    - There is a searchbar with an [autocomplete](https://material-ui.com/components/autocomplete/) above the products list - that filters the list of products as user types a search term
    - User can toggle light/dark/pink? theme of the app.
    - [`react-router`](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start) or  is used to lead to the checkout page, where user goes through a [stepper](https://material-ui.com/components/steppers/) to enter his address and credit card details in a multi step process.
    - Some items have limited quantity, and as user tries to increase the quantity on the cart, a [snackbar](https://material-ui.com/components/snackbars/#snackbars) appears with a warning notification that the stock is limited.
    - Items in the shop that have a quantity 0, can't even be added to the cart (are disabled)
    - The cart is accessible even for people with disabilities - it should be possible for people to use the full functionality even for people that are unable to use the mouse - they can use <kbd>TAB</kbd> or <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>TAB</kbd> or <kbd>Space</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd> to navigate and interact with the cart.
