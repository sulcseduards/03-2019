d) fourth choice  

# Up & Going @You Don't Know JS

```javascript
function foo(a) {
  console.log( a + b );
  let b = a;
}
foo( 2 );
```

What is the output?

a) 4  
b*) NaN  
c) 2  
d) Error  

***

How would you execute (call) this function?

```javascript
(function foo(){
  console.log( "Hello!" );
})();
```

a) This type of function expression syntax is not valid in JavaScript  
b) By calling it with foo();  
c*) No need to call it, it is immediately invoked by () at the end of the expression  
d) By calling it with foo.call();
  
***
Which of these data types are not available in JavaScript?


a)String
b)Boolean
c)Number
d*)Int
***
var a = [1,2,3]; 
var b = [1,2,3]; 
var c = "1,2,3";

a == c; 
b == c; 
a == b;

^^ Choice one answer ^^ 
a) NaN 
b) false, true, true 
c*) true, true, false 
d) Undefiend

What is the difference between “==” and “===” ?

a) ”==” sets values ”===” only compares values
b) ”===” sets values ”==” compares values
c*) ”==” only compares values “===” compare values and type both
d) ”===” only compares values “==” compare values and type both

# Scope @ Closures @You Don't Know JS

```javascript
function foo() {
  const a = 4;
  console.log( this.a );
}
var a = {
  a: 2
};
var b = {
  a:a,
  foo:foo,
  b: 'hello'
}
foo.call( b );
```

What is the output?

b) hello  
c) 2  
d) 4

Which of the following statemenets are false?

a) A block (identified by a pair of curly braces) does not define a new scope for _let_ and _const_, but it does for _var_  
b) A variable defined as _const_ or _let_ is also visible outside that block where it resides  
c) A variable defined as _var_ inside a function is visible in every part of program  
d*) All of the above  

***
```javascript
a=2
var a
console.log(a)
```
What's the expected output?
a) unidentified
b) null

# this & Object Prototypes @You Don't Know JS


Which of these is correct type assertion syntax?

What does the following code print to the console?

```javascript
var object = {
  foo: function() { return (this === object); }
}
console.log(object.foo());
```

a*) true  
b) false  
c) undefined  
d) ReferenceError: this is not defined  
#

```javascript
class MyClass{
     constructor(){
           this.useless = "UMP"
}
}
```
If you have this class what will happen if we execute this code?:
```javascript
MyClass.useless = "P90"
```
a)UMP" string changes to "P90
b)syntax error
c)creates a new variable in the object's instance
d*)creates a new static variable in MyClass

var globalObject = this; 
var foo = (() => this); 
console.log(foo() === globalObject);

^^ Choice one answer ^^ 
a) false, Simple call 
b) true, The Bind Method 
c*)true, The Arrow Function 
d) false, As an object method

What is this? In method,

Complete sentence.

a) this refers to the owner constructor.
b*) this refers to the owner object.
c) this refers to the owner properties.
d) this refers to the owner prototypes.


# Handbook @typescriptlang.org

```typescript
function buildName(firstName: string, lastName?: string) {
    if (lastName)
        return firstName + " " + lastName;
    else
        return firstName;
}
```

Which is the correct function call?

a*) let result1 = buildName("Bob");  
b)  let result2 = buildName("Bob", "Adams", "Sr.");  
c*) const result3 = buildName("Bob", "Adams");  
d*) var result4 = buildName("Bob");  

***

```typescript
function buildName(firstName = "Will", lastName: string) {
    return firstName + " " + lastName;
}
```

Which function call would not result in error?

a) let result1 = buildName("Bob");  
b) let result2 = buildName("Bob", "Adams", "Sr.");  
c*) let result3 = buildName("Bob", "Adams");  
d*) let result4 = buildName(undefined, "Adams");

Why is it important to assign data types to variables?

a)The code executes faster, but is a little more complex
b*)So you dont make a mistake by accidentally adding a different data type to a variable
c)So the code looks more complex and you'll have bragging rights
d)So you make less syntax errors

***

Which are different data types that are supported by Typescript and explain how to implement inheritance? 

a)Boolean: This can have values as true or false Number: This allows creating a user-defined data type. String: This can be any character value Array: This can be a list of numbers together Enum: This can be any number value

b*) Boolean: This can have values as true or false Number: This can be any number value String: This can be any character value Array: This can be a list of numbers together Enum: This allows creating a user-defined data type.

Static typing is feature in: 

a) Javascript
b*) Typescript
c) None.
d) Both.
